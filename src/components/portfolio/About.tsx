          Aspiring web developer experience in E-Commerce using Shopify,
          WooCommerce, and BigCommerce. Recently, I pivoted my career from
          back-end to front-end react developer due to challenge and interest in
          JavaScript technology.

          Currently, I am focus on installing, testing, and maintenance
          WordPress and WooCommerce websites. I typically use HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript in the client while using PHP, Python or Node.js for
          back-end.
